      During Winter quarter of 2023, I took the class
      Machine Intelligence and Art, which explored the ways
      AI could be used as a tool, topic, and muse for art. 
      For a project, my classmates and I decided to test
      particular text-to-image models in their capabilities
      in generating text as images. 
      <br><br>
      Starting in early January of 2023, the timing of this
      class corresponded with the rise of ChatGPT and the
      concerns educators had on its effects on education.
      Thus, I decided to make my project classroom-themed.
      <br><br>
      Using DALLE and Nightcafe, I generated posters that
      are often seen in a classroom, including a world map,
      a periodic table, and some inspirational quotes.
      <br><br>
      <img src="alphabet.jpg" alt="alphabet poster">

      <br><br>
      <img src="map1722.jpg" alt="world map poster">

      <br><br>
      <img src="motivational.jpg" alt="motivational quote poster">

      <br><br>
      <img src="periodicTable1722.jpg" alt="periodic table poster">
      <br>periodic table poster generated by DALLE
      <br><br>
      As you can see, DALLE did a pretty good job at capturing
      the aesthetic essence of these posters, but it lacked
      actual accuracy of text as image content. In 
      comparison, the world map looks better (although we have
      less familiarity with what the world map exactly looks like,
      so it is not really a fair comparison). 
      <br><br>
      To present the posters, we generated a classroom wall
      via DALLE, then extended it from its square dimensions
      using runway's Infinite Image model. We then projected
      this image onto the wall and hung the posters, creating
      the illusion that the posters were in an actual classroom.
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      We also used a laser cutter and 3d printer to
      create a puzzle based on the incorrect
      generated alphabet.
      <br><br>
      <img src="puzzle.png" alt="puzzle">

      <br><br>
      We ended up with a poster that couldn't fit on
      the projection wall, so we ended up putting it up
      on the door to the space - will someone notice it?
